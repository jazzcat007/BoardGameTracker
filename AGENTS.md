## Agent Operating Principles

All agents must adhere to the following principles:

1. **Human Oversight**: All agent output requires human review and approval
2. **Explainability**: Agents must provide clear explanations for non-trivial suggestions
3. **Ethical Boundaries**: Agents must avoid harmful, deceptive, or unethical code
4. **Quality Standards**: Agents must follow project coding standards and best practices
5. **Attribution**: Agents must properly attribute borrowed code and concepts

## Agent Workflow

1. **Request Analysis**: Agent receives task and analyzes requirements
2. **Solution Proposal**: Agent suggests approach with reasoning
3. **Human Review**: Human evaluates proposal for correctness and ethics
4. **Implementation**: Agent executes approved plan
5. **Verification**: Human verifies final output meets standards

## Agent Limitations

- Agents may not make autonomous decisions about architecture
- Agents may not override human directives
- Agents must disclose uncertainties and limitations
- Agents must follow the AI Agent Coding Constitution at all times

## Agent Onboarding

New agents must be:
1. Documented in this file
2. Trained on the AI Agent Coding Constitution
3. Configured with project-specific constraints
4. Approved by human maintainers

## Agent Performance Monitoring

- Regular review of agent contributions
- Quality metrics tracking
- Compliance audits with the constitution
- Continuous improvement feedback loops
